### R Repo

This is my repo for **STATS 220** for *semester one 2023*.

I will be using this repo for the following things:

- Stats220 Projects
- General R Projects

As more projects take off, I will reogranise to ensure the current project 
is the one reflected on the website. Feel free to take a look around this repo and
my other repos if you like.
